In few days, we will officially released the first alpha version of the SWS Pocket, an application to allow the students of the midweek meeting to view the meeting schedule. You can now already give the elligible students the necessary permission to access SWS Pocket app. A guide to do so has been published [here](/docs/faq/students/create-pocket-user).

Thank you!
